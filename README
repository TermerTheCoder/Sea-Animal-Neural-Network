Project Name: Sea Animal Detector Neural Network
Repository Name: Sea-Animal-Neural Network

About:
This is a small sample neural network that doesn't take any inputs
but shows the graph of the cost function. The data used is not 
indicative of the actual animal in real life and is just sample
data based on average measurements of the creature.
